	<intro>
        You awake feeling fuzzy and disoriented chained to a wall by your neck. As you try to wiggle free
        you bite the chain. To your surprise your bite has enough strength to crack the metal in the chain.
        It is only now that you look down and notice your left paw and hind leg are made of metal but you
        are able move like them like you would your own. Your pulse increases as you bite through the chain
        and use your retina display to scan the room...

            You are in the Cyborg Project Lab. The ceiling has several window like mirrors, probably two-way
            mirrors where humans could watch the room from above. You shudder as you wonder whether or not someone
            is on the other side now.
